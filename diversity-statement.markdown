### Diversity and Inclusiveness Statement

Bento Miso is a community that values and recognizes diversity, and defends and builds equitable experiences. We are committed not only to including marginalized voices and bodies, but also to actively fighting racism, sexism, and oppression in all its forms.

We **welcome** and **advocate for** the presence and contributions of all people regardless of their ability, age, body size, cultural background, education, ethnic origin, gender expression, gender identity, immigration status, language, marital status, nationality, physical appearance, political affiliations, race, religion, sexual orientation, sexuality, status as a parent, socioeconomic status, or other such factors.

Prejudice, oppression, and discrimination are detrimental to the health and growth of our community and the individuals who are a part of it. Supporting the visibility of our diverse lives enhances the experiences of all community members. We recognize and honor our differences and vigorously defend Bento Miso as a safe and equitable space.

### Have a suggestion?

The terms we use to describe our experience are always changing, and we are always learning. We are eager to maintain and defend the safety and inclusivity of this community, so:
