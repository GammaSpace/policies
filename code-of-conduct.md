# Code of Conduct

All **community participants** – including members, guests of members, staff, volunteers, event hosts, sponsors, presenters, exhibitors and attendees – are expected to abide by this code of conduct.

By becoming a member of Gamma Space, attending or hosting any event here, or joining our Slack team, you agree to abide by this code of conduct, and cooperate with organizers who enforce it.

## Anti-Oppression and Decolonization

We commit to actively working to inform, learn, teach, activate, model, and champion values and practices of anti-oppression and decolonization in all community activities and shared spaces. We understand this to be an iterative, humbling and rewarding process that requires time, care, compassion, love, attention, courageous and gracious commitment; that it involves continuous self-examination concerning our roles in society, culture, and history; and that it extends beyond compliance with diversity and human rights standards. Our goal is to dismantle power and privilege and mitigate systemic inequalities for those most affected by oppression and colonization – while investing in both personal growth and collective well-being. 

## Expected Behavior

We insist that everyone who uses this community space remains mindful of, and takes responsibility for, their speech and behavior. This includes:

- Always acting out of respect and concern for the wellbeing and free expression of others
- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions
- Respecting physical and emotional boundaries
- Not making assumptions about identity, experiences, or preferred pronouns
- Not using words that are racist, sexist, homophobic, classist, transphobic, cissexist or ableist
- Humbly accepting respectful correction (or correcting yourself), keeping in mind that the impact of your words on other people is more important than your intent

## Unacceptable Behavior

We believe that failing to address dynamics of hierarchy, power and privilege alienates and further victimizes members of a community and prevents us from creating the safe, equitable and welcoming space we want.

**We do not tolerate oppressive behavior, harassment, destructive behavior, or exclusionary actions.**

**Oppressive behavior**: any conduct that demeans, marginalizes, rejects, threatens or harms anyone on the basis of identity, background, or ability.

**Harassment**: deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; disruption of events; aggressive, derogatory, or threatening comments; and unwanted physical contact or sexual attention.

**Destructive behavior**: damaging or altering any part of the building, inside or out, including furniture, equipment, or other people's belongings.

**Exclusionary actions**: denying certain participants opportunities to share views, skills and other contributions; engaging in favoritism; and creating or reinforcing an inequitable learning environment.

## Enforcement

Anyone‭ ‬asked‭ ‬to‭ ‬stop‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬is‭ ‬expected‭ ‬to‭ ‬comply‭ ‬immediately.

Anyone who engages in sustained ‬unacceptable behavior may be sanctioned ‬or‭ ‬permanent‭ly ‬expelled‭ ‬from‭ ‬the‭ ‬community‭ ‬without‭ ‬warning‭ (‬and‭ ‬without‭ ‬refund‭ ‬in‭ ‬the‭ ‬case‭ ‬of‭ ‬a‭ ‬paid‭ ‬event‭)‬.

### What to do if you need help

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or experience marginalizing or silencing behavior that limits your full participation, please speak with the host of the event you are attending, a Gamma Space co-op member or volunteer. You can also report an incident to [coc@gammaspace.ca][1].

Your conversation will be held in confidence.

When you come to us with a problem during an event, it is our top priority to help you feel safe as quickly as possible. Next, a small group of community organizers and members will meet to decide what our response will be in accordance with our written conflict resolution and equity policies. Then, we will warn or remove the offender depending on the circumstances, taking your and the community's safety and wishes into account. If the problem does not impact your human rights or safety, we may ask the involved parties to leave the event and schedule a time to engage in negotiation and mediation at a later date.

Community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬are‭ ‬available‭ ‬to‭ ‬help‭ you ‬engage‭ ‬with‭ ‬local‭ ‬law‭ ‬enforcement (solely at your request).
